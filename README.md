# React-Native-Navigation

We are going to use version 3 of React Navigation.

Version 3 was just released and pretty new. At the time I write those line it was yesterday (November 17, 2018).

Anyway, I think it makes sense to use it in that article.

To start using the library, we need to install it first.

→ npm install --save react-navigation
→ npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler
→ react-native link
If you are using Expo SDK, there is no need to apply the last two commands, because that’s already included.

Once we apply those commands we are ready to use React Navigation
